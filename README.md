### About Me:
I am a 38-year-old student from Oulu University of Applied Sciences. As my main line of work I work as a morning host on a local radio station called [Radio Mega](https://mega.fi). In 2022, after 13 years of doing radio, I decided that it was time for a change. I started my studies as evening studies to be a [Bachelor of Engineering, Information Technology](https://oamk.fi/en/study-at-oamk/bachelor-s-degrees/beng-information-technology-2/) on January 2023. My goal is to graduate in 3,5 years, by June 2026.

### SEPARATE REPOS FOR COURSE FINAL EXERCISES
+ [**What's The Frequency?**](https://github.com/MacStache/WhatsTheFrequency)
  - The final exercise of Web Applications course. This web application allows the user to find the radio frequencies available
at the location that they are at right now. The site uses a script to parse the contents of a text file into a searchable table,
which hosts all the publicly available radio frequencies in Finland.
  - This is also running live on [GitHub](https://macstache.github.io/WhatsTheFrequency/)

### [PROJECTS](https://github.com/MacStache/TVT23KMO_HLaukka/tree/main/Projects)
I have also been heavily involved in these school projects:
+ [**PainehaavaPreventer8000**](https://github.com/MacStache/PainehaavaPreventer8000)
  - An Arduino project that involves two pressure sensors, an LCD and an Arduino that can be used to measure how long a person has sat still or been prone. This system can then be utilizes to prevent the formation pressure wounds.
  - I coded a lot of the pp8000.ino Arduino file for the project. The whole group had a hand in it though so can't really pinpoint what is and what is not done by me. I did do most of the LCD-functionality and tinkered a lot with the pressure sensors though. A really educational project for sure!
+ [**BankSystem08**](https://github.com/MacStache/TVT23KMO_HLaukka/tree/main/Projects/BankSystem)
  - A project from the Databases and JavaScript course which involves a backend running on a node.js Express server, an SQL-database and a QT frontend. I still need to do a proper readme.md with UI screenshots for this. I will update this when I have the time.
  - I coded most of the backend as well as the SQL procedures for this project. Was a really demanding project all-in-all, but we managed!
+ [**G12MovieDB**](https://github.com/MacStache/TVT23KMO_HLaukka/tree/main/Projects/G12MovieDB) 
  - We did a movie database as our final project for our Web Development courses. The project was done by using Java Springboot for the backend and React JS for the frontend. The database is PostgreSQL.
  - We all coded something for each portion of the project so I got to know the basics of Java Springboot, React JS and PostgreSQL.
  - Screenshots and a full readme included in the link.
