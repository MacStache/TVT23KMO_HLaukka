### [PROJECTS](https://github.com/MacStache/TVT23KMO_HLaukka/tree/main/Projects)
I have also been heavily involved in these school projects:

+ [**PainehaavaPreventer8000**](https://github.com/MacStache/PainehaavaPreventer8000)
  - An Arduino project that involves two pressure sensors, an LCD and an Arduino that can be used to measure how long a person has sat still or been prone. This system can then be utilizes to prevent the formation pressure wounds.
  - I coded a lot (if not most) of the pp8000.ino Arduino file for the project. The whole group had a hand in it though so can't really pinpoint what is and what is not done by me. I did do most of the LCD-functionality and tinkered a lot with the pressure sensors though. A really educational project for sure!
+ [**BankSystem08**](https://github.com/MacStache/TVT23KMO_HLaukka/tree/main/Projects/BankSystem)
  - A project from the Databases and JavaScript course which involves a backend running on a node.js Express server, an SQL-database and a QT frontend. I still need to do a proper readme.md with UI screenshots for this. I will update this when I have the time.
  - I coded most of the backend as well as the SQL procedures for this project. Was a really demanding project all-in-all, but we managed!
